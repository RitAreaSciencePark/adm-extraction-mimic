# adm-extraction-mimic
This repository will host the jupyter notebook to extract admissions in JSON format for the first 100 patients in the MIMIC-IV discharges
## How to run the notebook
First create a python virtualenv as explained in the orfeo [tutorial](https://orfeo-doc.areasciencepark.it/examples/jupyterlab/#running-the-notebook).

Then before running the notebook add a block inside it with the command
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

After the installation run the code in the notebook :)
